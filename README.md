# Inventory Manager
 
This is a project for managing an inventory in an RPG-like game. There are different types of items (Generic Items, Armor, Weapons), functions for sorting and optimizing the inventory by weight, and a command line interface for executing inventory commands. 

There are 6 commands:
1. Print Inventory - prints the contents of the inventory
2. Add item - adds a generic item
3. Add Armor item - adds an item of the type armor
4. Add Weapon item - adds an item of the type weapon
5. Optimize Equipment - equips the character with the best equipment in the inventory
6. Optimize Inventory - drops items so that the characters total weight is reduced to below the max weight
